PhotographyWebsite
==================

Hi, you're looking at the source of my photography website. 

It has been 'hacked' together using [https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/](reveal.js), an excellent HTML5 presentation framework by [http://hakim.se/](Hakim El Hattab).

The website can be viewed at http://marcduiker.github.io/PhotographyWebsite/ or http://www.marcduiker.nl. 

Cheers,
